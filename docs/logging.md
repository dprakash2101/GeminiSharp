# Logging with Serilog in GeminiSharp SDK

The **GeminiSharp SDK** uses **Serilog** for logging to provide detailed information about API requests, errors, and retries. To ensure logging works effectively, make sure you configure the logger at the application startup.

---

## Logging Configuration

In your `program.cs`, you can configure the Serilog logger with multiple sinks to capture logs at various levels. Below is an example of how you can configure Serilog to log messages to the **Debug Output**, **Console**, and **File**:

### Example Logger Configuration:

```csharp
using Serilog;

Log.Logger = new LoggerConfiguration()
    .MinimumLevel.Debug() // Capture Debug, Information, Warning, and Error level logs
    .WriteTo.Debug() // Send logs to Visual Studio Output Window
    .WriteTo.Console() // Optional: Output logs to the console
    .WriteTo.File("logs/app.log", rollingInterval: RollingInterval.Day) // Optional: Save logs to a file with daily rotation
    .CreateLogger();
```

### Explanation:

- **MinimumLevel.Debug()**: This sets the minimum log level to **Debug**, meaning that logs of levels **Debug**, **Information**, **Warning**, **Error**, and **Fatal** will be captured. You can adjust this depending on your needs.
  
- **WriteTo.Debug()**: This sends the log output to the **Visual Studio Output Window**, which is useful for debugging during development.
  
- **WriteTo.Console()**: This sends the log output to the **Console**, making it easier to see logs when running the application in a terminal or command prompt.
  
- **WriteTo.File("logs/app.log", rollingInterval: RollingInterval.Day)**: This writes logs to a file located in the **logs** folder. The logs will roll over daily, creating a new log file every day to keep the log data manageable.

## Example Log Output

With this configuration, youâ€™ll see logs in the following places:

1. **Visual Studio Output Window** (via `WriteTo.Debug()`)
2. **Console Output** (via `WriteTo.Console()`)
3. **Log File** (`logs/app.log` with daily rotation)

### Sample Logs:

```text
[10:00:00 INF] Starting application...
[10:00:01 DBG] Sending request to Gemini API for model "gemini-2.0-flash".
[10:00:05 ERR] API request failed with status code 503. Retrying...
[10:00:06 INF] Successfully generated content for model "gemini-2.0-flash".
```

## Using Logs to Track API Errors and Retries

Serilog captures detailed information about each retry attempt and the reason for retrying. For example:

```
Retrying due to transient error (status 503) on attempt 2. Waiting 2000ms. Error: {"error":"Service Unavailable"}
Retrying due to transient error (status 500) on attempt 3. Waiting 4000ms. Error: {"error":"Internal Server Error"}
```

This information is invaluable for debugging API issues and understanding the retry process.

## Conclusion

By configuring Serilog in your `program.cs`, you enable comprehensive logging for your GeminiSharp-based application. The logs will help you track API requests, errors, retries, and other important events, making it easier to monitor and troubleshoot your application.
