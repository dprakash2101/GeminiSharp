# GeminiSharp

GeminiSharp is a C# client SDK for seamlessly interacting with Google's Gemini API, enabling integration of Gemini's powerful text generation, image generation, and future capabilities into your .NET applications. With a simple, flexible, and robust interface, you can effortlessly generate content using the Gemini models.

---

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### 1. Installation

To install GeminiSharp via NuGet, run the following command in your project directory:

```bash
dotnet add package GeminiSharp
```

### 2. Configuration

The recommended way to use GeminiSharp is with dependency injection. In your `Program.cs` or `Startup.cs`, configure the Gemini clients as follows:

```csharp
using GeminiSharp.Extensions;

builder.Services.AddGeminiClient(options =>
{
    options.ApiKey = builder.Configuration["GeminiApiKey"];
    options.Model = "gemini-1.5-flash"; // Or any other suitable model
});
```

### 3. Usage

You can then inject the clients into your controllers or services:

```csharp
using GeminiSharp.Client;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;

[ApiController]
[Route("[controller]")]
public class MyController : ControllerBase
{
    private readonly GeminiClient _geminiClient;

    public MyController(GeminiClient geminiClient)
    {
        _geminiClient = geminiClient;
    }

    // ... your actions
}
```
